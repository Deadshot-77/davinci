# Changelog

## 0.2.0

`frontend-engineer` and its governing skill, `frontend-craft`, plus three defects
a live chain run found and fixed.

**Agents.** `frontend-engineer` (Opus 5, high effort) — art direction and build,
owns markup, components, styles, and public assets, with a capability-aware
perception loop: live browser preview when available, a headless-render fallback
when it isn't, and an honest "not verified" note in the report when neither is
possible. `backend-engineer` and `security-engineer` still don't exist.

**Skills.** `frontend-craft` — direction-first design judgment, the three design
dials, ten banned defaults, an accessibility floor, and a mechanical pre-flight.
Defers to `taste-skill` when installed alongside; falls back to its own guidance
when it isn't.

**Ceremony right-sizing.** A brief classified `trivial` now carries a
`Route: direct — <agent-name>` line; `tech-lead` skips the foundation gate for
it (quality gates still run). `intake-brief`'s classification line is now
mandated to be exactly `trivial` / `bounded` / `architectural` — a run found
`davinci` inventing "greenfield build" as a fourth label, which silently broke
the fast path; an unrecognised label now falls back to the full `bounded`
sequence instead of skipping steps.

**Scope move.** `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.svg` moved from `infra-architect` to
`frontend-engineer` — scaffolding and markup/styling are different concerns.
`hooks/test/scope.test.js` now asserts no two scoped agents share a glob, so
the two scopes can't drift back into overlap unnoticed.

**MCP allowlist security fix.** `frontend-engineer` ships with an exhaustive
`tools:` allowlist, not `disallowedTools`. A probe showed the denylist form
would have inherited every MCP tool connected in whatever installation runs
the plugin — desktop control, server management, messaging, deploy — none of
which the write-scope hook covers.

**Three live-run fixes**, found by an actual end-to-end chain run:

- Reports not matching the contract — `delegation-contract` now includes a
  literal copyable example report, verified against the validator by a unit
  test.
- Classification inventing labels outside the three the skill defines — the
  classification line is now mandated to one of three exact values.
- No way to detect unattended operation — `intake-brief` now has a rule for
  when no human can answer a clarifying question: decide, record the
  assumption, proceed. Never end a turn having only asked questions.

**Also:** the stack-profile requirement in `validate-report.js` is no longer
unconditional — it fires only on evidence of an actual scaffold, cross-checked
against `git status --porcelain` rather than trusting the self-reported
`files_changed` alone.

Test suite: 81 passing (up from 67 at the start of this increment).

**Known gap, carried forward.** The browser pane does not composite headlessly,
so the one real page this increment produced was verified structurally (DOM
read back), never visually. Browser-MCP access under the `tools:` allowlist is
confirmed by mechanism, not by direct sighting. See
`docs/verification-status.md`.

## 0.1.1

First live end-to-end run. Three defects found and fixed:

- Plugin agents are namespaced (`davinci:tech-lead`); rosters said `tech-lead`, so nothing
  could be dispatched. Hooks now normalise the prefix, and a Davinci agent missing from
  the scope map is denied rather than silently ungoverned.
- A main-thread agent’s `Agent(...)` roster is a session-wide allowlist, not that agent’s
  own limit, so restricting the entry agent blocked every downstream dispatch.
- The Bash guard blocked pure reads such as `node -e "JSON.parse(...)"`, preventing
  read-only agents from verifying anything.
- `infra-architect` no longer runs in an isolated worktree: its output was stranded there
  with no merge step, so the foundation never reached the agents depending on it.

## 0.1.0

First increment. The pipeline runs `davinci` -> `tech-lead` -> `infra-architect` -> `code-reviewer`,
with both enforcement hooks wired and 55 passing unit tests.

**Agents.** `davinci` (entry, clarifies and briefs), `tech-lead` (dispatch and arbitration,
no write tools), `infra-architect` (scaffolding and conventions, worktree-isolated),
`code-reviewer` (foundation gate and code review, read-only).

**Skills.** `intake-brief`, `delegation-contract`, `stack-profile`, `foundation-review`.

**Enforcement.** Per-agent write scoping including a best-effort Bash guard; report
validation that refuses to let an agent finish without real verification evidence, or a
gate finish without a verdict.

**Known gap.** The hooks are proven by direct invocation, not by a live Claude Code
session. See `docs/verification-status.md`.
